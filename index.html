    <h2>Fall 2016 Meeting Schedule </h2>
	<p>Meeting times have yet to be determined.</p>
<!--    <p>All meetings take place from 5:15-6:00pm in EB 3105 the first Wednesday of every month. </p> -->
    <h2> Leadership </h2>
    <p> Elected <a href="resources.html#Student" >Graduate Student Representatives</a> advocate for CSE graduate students at various committee and faculty   meetings, and provide the eyes, ears and voice of the CSE graduate   community at official functions. </p>
    <h2> Support </h2>
    <p> Whenever a CSE graduate student is in conflict with the university or   its constituents, the CSEGA will be there to provide unwavering and   resolute support for them. </p>
    <h2> Social Fellowship </h2>
    <p> The CSEGA organizes regular social activities (usually with PIZZA) to foster a community   that extends beyond the boundaries of individual laboratories, where   ideas are shared, and collaborations expand research horizons. The <a href="resources.html#Labs">Lab Liaisons</a> play a special role in this process. </p>
