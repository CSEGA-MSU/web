The <strong>C</strong>omputer <strong>S</strong>cience and <strong>E</strong>ngineering <strong>G</strong>raduate <strong>S</strong>tudent <strong>A</strong>ssociation (<strong>CSEGA</strong>, pronounced <em>see-sega</em>)   is an organization made for, of, and by the graduate students of the   Computer Science and Engineering Department whose mission is to promote <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>support</strong>, and <strong>social fellowship </strong>in the CSE graduate community.
</p>


<h2> Leadership </h2>
<p>
Elected <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecsega/w/Graduate_Student_Representatives" title="Graduate Student Representatives">Graduate Student Representatives</a> advocate for CSE graduate students at various committee and faculty   meetings, and provide the eyes, ears and voice of the CSE graduate   community at official functions.
</p>


<h2> Support </h2>
<p>
Whenever a CSE graduate student is in conflict with the university or   its constituents, the CSEGA will be there to provide unwavering and   resolute support for them.
</p>


<h2> Social Fellowship </h2>
<p>
The CSEGA organizes regular social activities to foster a community   that extends beyond the boundaries of individual laboratories, where   ideas are shared, and collaborations expand research horizons. The <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecsega/w/Lab_Liaisons" title="Lab Liaisons">Lab Liaisons</a> play a special role in this process.
