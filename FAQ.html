<h2> How do I get a key to the Engineering Building? </h2>
<p>
Access to the Engineering Building beyond normal operating hours is   granted via swipe card. Graduate students are not given after-hours   access to the Engineering Building by default, but students can acquire   it if needed. To activate your MSU ID for access to the Engineering   Building, follow these steps. First, explain to your faculty advisor why   you require access. Then, your adviser will notify Norma Teague of your   need. Norma will, in turn, process your request to have access to the   Engineering Building added to your ID. To expedite your request, please   have your advisor include your PID and proxy number (the number   following the * on the back of your MSU ID) with the request.
</p>
 
<p>
Access to labs and offices is by key. You may request a key to   your lab or office through your advisor as well. The process is the   same. You will make a request to your advisor who will then submit the   request to Norma Teague, who will in turn issue you a key. Finally, pick   up your key from Norma in the CSE office. You must return your key to   Norma prior to graduation, or the department will place a hold on your   degree. Please direct any questions you have regarding building keys to <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecsega/mediawiki/index.php?title=Kayra_Hopkins&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Kayra Hopkins (not yet written)">Kayra Hopkins</a>.

<h2> How do I access on-line resources like the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore when I'm off campus? </h2>
<p>
You can access these resources using the library's proxy server. The   easiest way to use the proxy is to simply search for materials via the   MSU Library's <a href="http://er.lib.msu.edu/" title="http://er.lib.msu.edu/" rel="nofollow">Electronic Resources page</a>. If you use a firewall, you will need to allow outgoing connections on ports 2047 and 443.
