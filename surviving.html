      <li>Have a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly plan.</li>
      <li>Important form dates and deadlines? They should be on your calendar immediately.</li>
      <li>Some reviewers are just...not nice...</li>
      <li>If you are having trouble, ask for help sooner rather than later.</li>
      <li>Find the graduate student in the lab who has been their the longest. Ask what is expected of people in the lab, and ask them to show you how to use the equipment.</li>
      <li>An extra semester is worth it, if it means staying  sane (mostly)</li>
      <li>Don't forget to sleep. Lack of sleep makes everything seem worse.</li>
      <li>Eventually you are going to have to say &quot;no&quot; to keep your health.</li>
      <li>Those fuzzy deadlines will came back to haunt you if you don't make them concrete on your own.</li>
